# Piwigo Mobile
Piwigo Mobile is a native iOS Application for [Piwigo](http://piwigo.org).

[Piwigo](http://piwigo.org) is a **free and opensource** web photo gallery, built by an active community of users and developers.

[Piwigo](http://piwigo.org) empowers you to create your own photo gallery on the web and includes many powerful features such as albums, tags, geolocation, many levels of customization, upload by visitors, privacy, calendar or statistics.

## Description
[Piwigo Mobile](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/piwigo/id472225196?mt=8) for iPhone/iPad supplements the photo gallery software in the cloud [Piwigo.com](http://iwigo.com) and self-hosted Piwigo galleries (2.7 or higher):

- Browse your albums,
- Create new albums,
- Delete, move and rename albums,
- Edit, download and delete photos & videos,
- Set a photo as album image,
- Upload photos:
   - of modifiable size and quality,
   - with description, author, tags, EXIF metadata,
   - with or without GPS metadata,
- Upload videos.

## Videos 
For video upload using your iOS device, you need the plugin on your Piwigo server titled "[piwigo-videojs](http://piwigo.org/ext/extension_view.php?eid=610)". After you have installed this plugin, you will need to allow for video file types to be uploaded by following [these instructions](https://github.com/xbgmsharp/piwigo-videojs/wiki/How-to-add-videos).

Your Piwigo server generates a poster of each uploaded video with [FFmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org) (or [avconv](https://libav.org/documentation/avconv.html) from [Libdav](https://libav.org)). If neither of these solutions is installed, the upload will fail. From to our experience, we recommand to install the 'true' [FFmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org).
